[![Demo Link](http://dhruvjani.in/img/demo_icon.png)](http://dhruvjani.in/github/jQuery-Star-Feedback-System/)

This is a simple jQuery based UI/UX Design for providing feedback in star format. This example also allows user to validate and get response in PHP to be stored in database.

  - This can be used for product/services feedback
  - This can allow web apps to get information in star count
  - This can also help rate a product on various sub-functions and average it out
